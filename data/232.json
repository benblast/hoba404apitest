{"name":"HOBA404 #232","description":"Honey Badger 404 is a collection of super fine honey badger ERC404 tokens - kinda unique but still kinda fungible collectibles that will survive as long as Ethereum survives. 888 Honey Badgers have been shoddily slapped together from a veritable boatload of combinations - all using a run of the mill randomizer thing. Enjoy responsibly and remember that HOBA don't care about anything.","image":"https://hoba404.netlify.app/data/232.png","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Background","value":"Fake Png"},{"trait_type":"Body","value":"Black Gimp Suit"},{"trait_type":"Head","value":"Cute"},{"trait_type":"Glasses","value":"Salmon Moggles"},{"trait_type":"Headwear","value":"Red Gnome Hat"}]}
