{"name":"HOBA404 #210","description":"Honey Badger 404 is a collection of super fine honey badger ERC404 tokens - kinda unique but still kinda fungible collectibles that will survive as long as Ethereum survives. 404 Honey Badgers have been shoddily slapped together from a veritable boatload of combinations - all using a run of the mill randomizer thing. Enjoy responsibly and remember that HOBA don't care about anything.","image":"https://hoba404api.herokuapp.com/data/210.png","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Background","value":"Hot Pink Checkerboard"},{"trait_type":"Body","value":"Red Gimp Suit"},{"trait_type":"Head","value":"Happy"},{"trait_type":"Headwear","value":"Sonic Hat"},{"trait_type":"Overlay","value":"Boomer Badger"}]}
